# Power Supply Circuit with 7812 Integration - Proteus Project

## Overview

This project is a power supply circuit simulation created in Proteus (version 8.14), integrating the popular 7812 voltage regulator. The primary objective is to provide a virtual platform for understanding, designing, and testing a regulated power supply circuit using the 7812 IC. This simulation enables users to observe the behavior of the voltage regulator and its impact on the overall stability and output of the power supply.

## Features

- Simulates a regulated power supply circuit using the 7812 voltage regulator.
- Provides insights into the design and behavior of a voltage-regulated power supply.
- Allows users to explore variations in input voltage, load conditions, and observe the corresponding output.
